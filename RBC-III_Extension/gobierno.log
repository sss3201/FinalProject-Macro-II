[Warning: Some of the parameters have no value (B) when using steady. If these parameters are not initialized in a steadystate file or a
steady_state_model-block, Dynare may not be able to solve the model. Note that simul, perfect_foresight_setup, and
perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically call the steady state file.]
